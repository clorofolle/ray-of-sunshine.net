                    <p>
                        Struffoli (singular: struffolo) are a traditional christmas dessert here in Naples and in the surrounding region. 
                        They're small sweet dough balls, deep fried and coated with honey. <br>
                        They're one of my favorite sweet dishes ever, and they're extremely easy to make, so I'm sharing my recipe!
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            ❧ 500g of flour (I use <a href="https://www.schaer.com/en-int/p/mix-c-patisserie">Schaer's Mix C</a> for my gluten-free needs, 
                            but it doesn't matter, any all purpose will do!)
                            ❧ 5 eggs <br>
                            ❧ ~40 grams of butter (melted, but not fuming hot!) <br>
                            ❧ ~75 grams of sugar <br>
                            ❧ 1 pinch of cinnamon (or more - only you know how bland your 5 yrs old cinnamon is) <br>
                            ❧ grated zest of 1 lemon <br>
                            ❧ grated zest of 1 orange <br>
                            ❧ 50 ml of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strega_(liqueur)">Strega liqueur</a> 
                            <span class="smallerfont">(a bit of hard liqueur helps with the pastry, and this traditional one has a lot of spices, so helps in giving them a nice aroma. 
                            You could probably substitute with a more flavourless hard liqueur and add some more aromas on the side imo! When I'm out, I substitute with some limoncello, myself.)</span>  <br>
                            ❧ 1 pinch of baking soda <br>
                            ❧ 1 pinch of salt <br>
                            ❧ honey (must be liquid and not harden) <br>
                            ❧ (sprinkles and candied fruit to taste, to decorate!) <br>

                            <h2>Preparation</h2>
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            They're really easy to make!<br>
                            <br>
                            ❧ Mix all the ingredients (save for the honey and decorative candied fruit/sprinkles) together 
                            to make a dough. It should be pretty soft and easy to work with, like play dough. If it's too 
                            hard you need a bit more liquid - a pinch of liqueur more should do. If it's way too soft, conversely, 
                            add a pinch more flour.<br>
                            <br>
                            ❧ The canonical way to make the lil balls is to roll the pastry into thin sticks, then cut them in half a cm little pieces. 
                            In my household we actually roll them into balls one by one. We love to suffer! Except for me - I LOVE rolling these 
                            little dough spheres. Gluten free flour also usually react a little differently, so we find it best to roll them one by one.<br>
                            <br>
                            ❧ Then you deep fry in a small, tall pan full of oil, until they're golden. I usually fry them in batches.<br>
                            <br>
                            ❧ Once the whole batch is done, and they've cooled down enough, you can mix them in a big bowl with honey, candied fruit, and sprinkles. 
                            They taste even better once you allow them to set a bit in the honey!<br>
                            I don't like to eat the candied fruit, but it also infuses a really good taste in the honey, so I still recommend putting in some, 
                            even if you're not a fan.<br>
                            <br>
                            ❧ Enjoy!!!
