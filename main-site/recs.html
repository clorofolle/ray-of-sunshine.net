                                                My favorite tumblr blog and one of my favorite artists. Her blog is a wonderfully crafted collection of inspiring posts and images, diligently <a href="https://itstaishe.carrd.co/#catadromisleading">tagged by what I can only describe as "deep vibe"</a>. A trip down the right tags usually leaves me in tears, deeply inspired, filled with a newfound zest for life and love for humans or, most commonly, all of the above.<br>
                                                Also, her art is amazing. Here's a sample if you wish (with links to the original post.)

                                            I am pretty sure I discovered at least 3 new emotions just by reading her poetry - and a couple more by reading other people's own wikipedia poems, that she <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/headspace-hotel/tagged/wikipedia%20poetry">reblogs under the tag "wikipedia poetry"</a>. I love this art medium so much.

Playpen balls fill her house, and a small gate is keeping them in. Cueball: 'Hey, I was wondering if you had plans for-- holy crap, what happened to your apartment?'. Megan: 'I filled it with playpen balls!'. Cueball: 'I... What? Why?'. Second Panel: Megan: 'Because we're grown-ups now, and it's our turn to decide what that means'. Third panel: Megan has gone back inside. Cueball is still at the doorway, taken aback. Fourth panel: Cueball is not in front of the door anymore; the small gate keeping the playpen balls inside is now open, and the balls overflow from the open door. A heart shaped baloon floats out of the door.">

I run a lot of searches and do it daily - and although I had tried switching to other, more private search engines in the past, I had always failed to adapt. They all felt worse than google to me in terms of how quickly I could find what I was looking for - and google itself was getting more and more exasperating.

                                        It's really hard to go back to google once you try an actually good search engine, IMO. I love being able to search directly on the smallweb, in forums, or in academic research websites; I love the way they integrate generative AI in a manner that's actually useful (you can have it summarize the results of your search, or summarize each single page you find on your search); I love being able to blacklist certain sites altogether.

                                        Kagi still falls victim to SEO optimization to a degree, so I still have to avoid the endless pits of "top 10 products to X!" while searching for some keywords, but it still manages to be a superior experience in the long run.

I found Marc Dingman's videos to be informative, clear, and concise. I especially like the 10 minute ones and - much like he suggests - I find it useful to pause, rewind, and re-watch them.

                                                Being a fellow curious human who wants to do a bit of everything, this channel is a treasure of inspiration and serotonin. I guess it's lovely to see there's people like you out there, and who actually managed to start dabbling in a bit of everything, following their own curiosity.

                                            Before switching over to youtube, he recorded his miscellaneous projects over a website. There's a quote on that website that I think distilled well the essence of his channel, and that stuck with me over the years:
                                        </p>

                                            <br>
                                            Founded a short time after my 40th birthday, the site has been described by some as documentary of my mid-life crisis. Maybe that's not entirely untrue - looking back, it does mark a bit of a turning point, when I <span class="purple">stopped just formulating lists of things I might find interesting to do, and started doing them.<br>

                                            My lists of future projects don't ever seem to get any shorter and most of the items on them are quite trivial, but it means I seldom experience boredom.</span>"</i>

                                                A friends of Atomic Shrimp, with whom he collaborates frequently. Mr Babatunde is a Nigerian teacher, who reached out to Shrimp during a hard time in the pandemic for the possibility of a video collaboration. From that cultural exchange a friendship was born, and the viewers were so supportive, they encouraged him to set up a Patreon and a channel of his own!<br>
                                                The revenue from Patreon helps support him and his neighbors.

                                            <p>
                                                He's set in rural Nigeria and, despite the channel name, he of course can only talk about his own experiences. Even then, Nigeria is a big and diverse country, as he often explains himself. For any westerner, it's a fascinating and helpful way to experience one of those cultures that are rarely really shown by the people living them, from the inside.
                                            </p>

                                                He's a lovely guy who makes up for his inexperience in video-making with interesting content, sunny attitude, and some funny disasters in the kitchen. Much like Atomic Shrimp, his videos cover a variety of topic, so there's something for everyone!

                                            Joplin is something of a second brain for me. Just as I keep a physical bullet journal for helping me with daily, short-term tasks and reminders, I use Joplin as a sort of "long term memory". Anything I know I want to find again gets stored there, properly tagged and in a notebook that makes sense for me.

                                            I also use it as a "notes" app for active projects: it's almost always open while I work on this website for example, as I will write down all my plans and links to things I don't want to forget.

For everyone!</em> The "Premium" costs 10$/yr and gives some small perks I think - but it's really just the way it supports being free for everyone else. I personally am a supporter, because it's a service that's worth it and that I'm happy stays free.

                                            Since command lines can be tricky to navigate, a Graphical User Interface is much appreciated! This one doesn't try to intall any undesired software, and just does its job neatly. It's an one-person hobby project, but works quite flawlessly.
