                        <h4>Andrew Kane —from <a href="https://www.rattle.com/print/60s/i69/">Rattle #69, Fall 2020</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            If you want to be a dog, first you must learn to wait. You must wait<br>
                            all day until somebody returns, and if somebody returns late, you<br>
                            must learn to wait until then. Then you must learn to speak in one<br>
                            of the voices available to you, high and light or mellow thick and<br>
                            low or middle-range and terse. Whichever voice you learn to speak,<br>
                            you will meet somebody who does not like you because of it, they<br>
                            will be wary or annoyed or you will remind them of something or<br>
                            someone else. Once you have learned to speak you must learn not to<br>
                            speak unless you absolutely must, or to speak as much as you feel<br>
                            you must regardless of how many times you are told to stop, or sit,<br>
                            or placed behind a door—this will depend on <a class="discreetlink" href="../thoughts/dogtheory.html">what kind of a dog</a> you<br>
                            want to be. And indeed there are many kinds. It may not feel as though<br>
                            you get to choose, and that too is a kind of dog. Next you must learn<br>
                            to relinquish all control over everything you might wish to control. You<br>
                            must learn to prefer to be led about by the neck on a piece of string,<br>
                            or staked to a neglected lawn by a length of chain. You must learn, once<br>
                            you have sampled the freedom of a life without a chain, that it is better<br>
                            to return and be chained again. Or you may learn that it is not—<br>
                            a fugitive is also a kind of dog. Of course you must learn to love, to<br>
                            love always and love entirely and to be wounded by nothing so much<br>
                            as the violence of your own love. You must learn to be confused but<br>
                            never disappointed by a deficiency of love. You must give up your<br>
                            children and not know why. You must lose yourself wholly in activity;<br>
                            you must never feel an itch that you do not scratch. You must learn how<br>
                            to wait at the foot of the bed and hope, silently, that somebody is drunk<br>
                            enough or lonely enough to invite you up, and you must learn not to show<br>
                            your excitement too much or overplay your hand. If you want to be a dog,<br>
                            you must learn to believe that you are not in fact a dog at all.

                                        the universe goes through repeated cycles <br>

                                        the existence of altruism in nature is at first sight puzzling, <br>
                                        such love might exist between family members, <br>
                                        “unconditional selflessness” to a tree.<br>

                                        ancient greek philosophers identified six forms of love: <br>
                                        flower, leaf, stem, bark, root, seed. <br>
                                        six gingko biloba specimens survived the atomic bombing of <br>
                                        hiroshima, <br>
                                        1 to 2 kilometers from ground zero. <br>
                                        they still live there today.<br>

                                    field with his mother. It is a perfect<br>
                                    summer evening: the moon rising over<br>

                                    And as he stares into the sky, there<br>
                                    are twice as many stars as usual.

                                    There is a secret to it—how a frog egg becomes a<br>
                                    frog. It is a secret that only frogs know and<br>
                                    they pass this knowledge on from generation to<br>
                                    generation, improving it, changing it slightly<br>
                                    over the millions of years, but never losing the<br>
                                    fundamental knowledge of how to become a frog.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Humans now understand how this secret is handed<br>
                                    down through the generations. All the necessary<br>
                                    information is carried on the chromosomes of each<br>
                                    cell of every frog, from parent to child and to that<br>
                                    child's children.

                                    But although humans understand how the secret is<br>
                                    passed along, only the frogs know what the secret<br>
                                    is.

                                    in the gutter and the gutter is filling<br>
                                    with water because the sewer is clogged.
                                </p>

                                    If the dog were alive he would be drowning<br>
                                    but as it is, the water is simply stroking<br>
                                    his fur.

                                    Some of us die young<br>
                                    because we want to know<br>
                                    everything.</h4>

                                <p>
                                    You lived too soon.<br>
                                    If you had waited,<br>
                                    if you had slowed down<br>
                                    for a moment<br>
                                    I might have caught up with you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Instead, I was always arriving<br>
                                    just as you were ready to leave.<br>
                                    Our few moments together<br>
                                    were always spent saying good-bye.
                                </p>

                                    But that summer our timing was off.<br>
                                    I arrived but you were<br>
                                    already gone.
                                </p>

                                    I looked for you<br>
                                    among the faces at the airport<br>
                                    but you were not there.

                                    I went back to the places<br>
                                    where we used to meet<br>
                                    but you were not there.

                                    I've heard that<br>
                                    when a person dies<br>
                                    he sees his whole life<br>
                                    pass before him.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Is that true? Did you<br>
                                    see me in that last moment?<br>
                                    Was I there?
                                </p>

                                    The children we never had<br>
                                    are dying inside me.<br>
                                    Their faces are moons<br>
                                    on dark water.<br>
                                    They drift closer and closer<br>
                                    almost within reach.
                                </p>

                                    Their eyes float open<br>
                                    milk white and blind.<br>
                                    They dream of waking.<br>
                                    I dream of holding them<br>
                                    asleep in my arms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I hear their heartbeats<br>
                                    like the echo in seashells<br>
                                    deep inside me. For a moment<br>
                                    I could almost feel them<br>
                                    their feet and elbows nudging me<br>
                                    their small bodies turning.
                                </p>

                                    Now they are sinking<br>
                                    deeper and deeper into me<br>
                                    holding their twisted life lines<br>
                                    in their hands, attached<br>
                                    to nothing.
                                </p>

                                    floats on the dark water.<br>
                                    Not even the moon.

                            il cielo ingombro, tragico, disfatto:<br>
                            bianca bianca nel tacito tumulto<br>
                            una casa apparì sparì d'un tratto;<br>
                            come un occhio, che, largo, esterrefatto,<br>
                            s'aprì si chiuse, nella notte nera.

                        <p>
                            E nella notte nera come il nulla,<br>
                            a un tratto, col fragor d'arduo dirupo<br>
                            che frana, il tuono rimbombò di schianto:<br>
                            rimbombò, rimbalzò, rotolò cupo,<br>
                            e tacque, e poi rimareggiò rinfranto,<br>
                            e poi vanì. Soave allora un canto<br>
                            s'udì di madre, e il moto di una culla.

        <h5>Mi salva un po' la vita</h5>
        <p>
            Ogni tanto, su tumblr, becco la dicitura "this saves my life a little", spesso in riferimento a poesie od altre opere d'arte. Non riesco a trovare la fonte di quest'espressione. Qualcuno la conosce?
        </p>

        <h5>Topo d'acqua</h5>
        <p>
            Anni dopo aver letto per la prima volta questa poesia, l'ho visto anch'io, in un paese straniero, un topo d'acqua! Era il 2019, ero a Praga - tra le papere ed i cigni compare una <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocastor_coypus">nutria</a>: un grosso ratto bagnato, un po' castoresco e molto speranzoso (di cibo, s'intende).
        </p>
        <p>
            Questa poesia era per me un piccolo assioma d'amore. A quei tempi, non mi sarei sognata di raccontare a qualcuno dei miei incontri con nutrie e topi d'acqua - men che meno con orgoglio. Ero abituata allo scherno, ed avevo imparato a nascondermi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conosco ora questo amore, e questa poesia si è fatta ancora più dolce.

            "I wish that I could spread my wings<br>
            And fly until the morning<br>
            I wish that I could taste the air<br>
            And behold all before me            
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps I'd fly so high<br>
            That I would find it hard to breathe<br>
            The choice to fall from heaven<br>
            Has been stolen away from me"
