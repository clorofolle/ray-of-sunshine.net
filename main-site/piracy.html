                    <strong><h3>DISCLAIMER</h3></strong>
                    Piracy is illegal. Something being illegal doesn't mean it's always ethically wrong. 
                    Still - be cautious as pirating without proper precautions could get you fined depending on your 
                    country. <br>
                    <span class="purple">If you can afford to, always support small creators and artists!</span><br>
                    Another thing to keep in mind: I'm not a pro - I'm not even a real geek. If you know your stuff and notice 
                    an error in what I wrote, please do email me and point it out! I'm always trying to learn more.

                        Culture, at large, should be accessible by as a larger number of people as possible.<br>
                        I personally believe there are situations where pirating copyrighted content is acceptable:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Piracy for "checking out" a thing and see if you like it before buying it / supporting the creator is always okay.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When it comes to small creators, indie companies, people and organizations for whom 
                                that money does make a difference, supporting them financially is always the best choice, 
                                as long as you can afford to.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When it comes to large corporations that actively make a large amount of profit, piracy is usually okay. 
                                Pirates make but a small percentage of their user base. The Pokemon Company won't care if you don't buy their latest game. 
                                They grossed 11.6 billion dollars just from licensed goods in 2022.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Piracy for emulation purposes is always okay. Fuck Nintendo and fuck games from 20 yrs ago being sold at the same price they were sold back then.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When actively boycotting a company, piracy should be avoided as well - or if you do pirate and enjoy 
                                their products, avoid talking about them with other people. This will still give them exposure and good publicity. 
                                Piracy isn't always detrimental to a company.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Adobe software must always be pirated. Follow the ancient law.

                    <summary>
                        <h4>☀ !!SAFETY PRECAUTIONS!!</h4>
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        First off: <span class="orange" style="font-weight: bold;">ADBLOCKERS.</span> It's dangerous to go alone. <br>
                        Take this: <span class="purple">a little browser add-on that will prevent you from seeing ads and popups ever again!</span> Yeah, no more ads on Youtube either. <br>
                        <span class="purple">Most malware you risk getting while pirating is the result of ads and pop-ups!</span><br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-size: smaller;">Some time ago, Google announced that <span class="purple">Chrome will drop support for 
                        adblockers</span>. This was set to happen in early 2023, then again postponed to June 2024. I'm not sure how long 
                        Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave) will still support third-party adblockers.<br>
                        This is simply happening because Google (who mantains Chromium) is in big parts an Ad Company, and so makes money from selling ads to you.<br>
                        <span class="purple"><a href="https://firefox.com/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a> is not affiliated to Google, and will support Adblocking indefinitely.</span> Just so you know.</span><br>
                        <br>
                        The BEST Ad Blocker around is <span class="orange">uBlock Origin, by Raymond Hill (gorhill)</span>.<br>
                        It's recommended that you use it at all times, as it will not slow down your browser but will improve your user experience drastically!<br>
                        Official add-on installs: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=it" target="_blank">Chrome (for now)</a>.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then: <span class="orange" style="font-weight: bold;">VPNs</span>. There's a growing trend going 
                        around that would lead you to believe that you should always use a VPN and your internet activity is inherently unsafer without one. 
                        That is blatantly false, and I have a deep disdain for companies that try to make you believe otherwise.<br>
                        However, there's one thing that VPNs are absolutely essential for, and that is <span class="orange">torrenting</span>. <br>
                        <span class="purple">You don't have to care about a VPN as long as you use Direct Downloads (more on that later), but with torrenting, it's a must!</span><br>
                        <br>
                        ...ok, well. You <em>can</em> download things without a VPN. I've done it a bunch - but I'm in Italy, and controls are lax here.<br>
                        Please understand though, that's unsafe. <span class="purple">VPNs are, like, the <em>condoms of torrenting</em></span>.<br> 
                        Depending on how strict your Internet Service Providers are about piracy, <span class="purple">without them you might get a hefty fine, or simply a warning, or nothing at all.</span><br>
                        <span class="purple" style="text-decoration: underline;">If you're located in Germany</span> for example, expect to be REALLY CAUTIOUS and not screw up, otherwise it's fine time!<br>
                        <span class="purple">With torrenting, sadly, ISPs can kind of exactly see what you're downloading. VPNs fool your ISP.</span> Again - I'm not a fan of how much VPN services are fooling us 
                        in thinking we need them - but sadly us pirates DO need them.<br>
                        <br>
                        I would personally <span class="purple">not recommend free VPNs</span>, they aren't too reliable in my experience.<br>
                        I also advice to use a VPN that allows <span class="purple">“port forwarding”</span> as that will make the downloads faster.<br>
                        But in the end, <span class="purple">any VPN service will do.</span> This is a post with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/rikthc/list_of_recommended_vpns_2022/" target="_blank">current list of recommented VPN services</a>! 
                        I personally go with Mullvad, they seem really transparent about what they do, and I don't mind not having port forwarding.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>If you use a VPN service to keep safe during torrenting, it's essential that you take one last precautional step.</strong><br>
                        At times, <span class="purple">the VPN connection you are using might falter for some seconds</span>. These few seconds that it's not working, your torrent might still be downloading, 
                        exposing your IP address briefly and letting your ISP catch you.<br>
                        There is an easy and quick way to prevent this from happening. 
                        It's called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/ssy8vv/guide_bind_vpn_network_interface_to_torrent/" target="_blank"><span class="orange"><strong>binding the VPN network interface to your torrent client</strong></span></a> - 
                        it's a big name, but it means <span class="purple">you tell your client (qBittorrent) to ONLY connect to the internet via the VPN.</span><br>
                        No VPN? No connection. No IP leakage. Linked guide above will take you a couple minutes at most.

                    <p>
                        <span class="purple">There are two kinds of downloads: Direct Downloads and Torrents.</span><br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="orange">Direct Download Link (DDL):</span> you click on the thing, the browser downloads it. Simple! 
                        It's an 1 on 1 communication between you and their servers.<br>
                        Pros: no hassle, super <span class="purple">easy</span>, nothing else to do, 
                        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/id27my/comment/g26kxlc/?context=3" target="_blank">pretty safe</a>.<br>
                        Cons: downloading big files is <span class="purple">sloooow</span>, and if your connection falters just a few seconds, you gotta start from the top again.<br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="orange">Torrenting: the good stuff</span>.<br>
                        It's <span class="purple">“Peer to Peer”, or P2P</span>. The way I understand it: 
                        you're put in a room <span class="purple">(a “swarm”)</span> with a bunch of people.<br>
                        <span class="purple">Some want the file (Peers and Leechers)</span>, 
                        some already have it and <span class="purple">are giving it around (Seeders)</span>.<br>
                        You all share small pieces of the file around, and eventually everyone will get a complete file.<br>
                        Seeders are the most important part: 
                        <span class="purple">a torrent with zero seeders will not start</span> (no one is giving out the file). 
                        A torrent with 200 seeders will be immensely faster than one with 3 seeders.<br>
                        <br>
                        It's <span class="purple"><strong>good etiquette to seed back</strong></span> what you download, 
                        in a 1:1.10 ratio: you upload what you downloaded (1:1) and then a little more. Sharing is caring!<br>
                        Pros: <span class="purple">fast</span>, you can stop and resume whenever you want, 
                        you can find torrents of mostly anything, <span class="purple">easy to download big files</span>.<br>
                        Cons: <span class="purple">unsafe without a VPN</span> (might get fined), <span class="purple">a bit harder</span> to understand, 
                        might take an hour or two to set everything up. Still, it's <span class="purple">the main way to easily pirate things</span>.
                        <br>
                        <span class="orange">How to Torrent files?</span><br>
                        You will need: a Torrent Client, a VPN (optional, recommended), and either a .torrent file or a magnet link. Don't panic, this is easy!<br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="orange">Torrent Client:</span> a little software that will actually manage the downloading. 
                        There is no reason to use anything else than <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/download" target="_blank"><span class="orange">qBittorrent</span></a>: 
                        it's free, open source, frequently updated, has no ads, <span title="it's port forwarding!"> and has a neat little feature that we will see later. </span>
                        Download and install it and you're all set!<br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="orange">VPN:</span> more info on them in the "Safety Precautions" section.<br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="orange">Torrent files, magnet links:</span> 
                        a torrent file is an actual file you download and open in your client. 
                        You download “bee_move.torrent”, <span class="orange">open it in qBittorrent, and it will start downloading</span>!<br>
                        A magnet link simply bypasses having an actual file. it's a link that you will directly open in your 
                        client and will tell it what it needs to know, and acts in place of a .torrent file. They're virtually the same.<br>
                        <span class="purple">There are dedicated torrent sites that let you search for the torrent you want,</span> 
                        and offer either a torrent file or magnet download. Let's see how to find them!

                        From books to music to, uh, adult material. I usually <span class="purple">refer to the masterpost to know which sites 
                        are the most trustworthy, and then use unblockit to access them.</span> 
                        Generally, for example, you will want to avoid ThePirateBay, and prefer 1337x instead.<br>
                        <br>
                        I will also leave some more specific links and resources in the following sections! :-)

                        As always: when it comes to resources created by small artists, please do purchase them if you can 
                        afford to. If you can't afford to, or just want a taste of them, however:<br>

                        has, like, an INFINITY of art courses and tutorials, and even some software. It's INSANE, super helpful, 
                        some of these courses would otherwise cost SO much. I've been getting a lot of use out of it. 
                        They're mostly DDLs, too! I can't recommend it enough!!<br>
                        <br>
                        I've had a lot of difficulty finding good brushes for Procreate that didn't cost too much. 
                        This telegram channel has a neverending quantity of Procreate brushes: 
                        <a href="https://t.me/free_brushes/" target="_blank"><span class="orange">☀ t.me/free_brushes</span></a>.<br>
                        Sometimes Photoshop brushes crop up too. For some popular brushes, they ask for “donations” to download them 
                        instead of giving the actual download, which is a big yikes. Thankfully, it's rare. 
                        In there, if you scroll really far, there's also a link to another smaller group to download

                        My favourite way to pirate and share music is 
                        <a href="http://www.slsknet.org/" target="_blank"><span class="orange">☀ Soulseek</span></a>, 
                        a neat little software that work as a Peer To Peer service, but between you and a single other person at a time. 
                        You share all your music folder, and others can download from it when you're online. 
                        In return, you can download other people's music from their shared folders.<br>
                        It's lovely, the quality of the files is GREAT, the community is actually really chill and honest, 
                        since it's just a bunch of peeps sharing mp3s and flacs.<br>
                        <br>
                        There's also a LOT of telegram bots to download music or videos from several platforms.<br> 
                        @MusicDownloaderRobot downloads from Spotify, @joeymusicbot from Deezer, @mediadownbot rips videos and music from stuff like reddit, tiktok, facebook, twitter etc, 
                        and <a href="https://t.me/BotsArchive" target="_blank"></a> t.me/BotsArchive has a vast collection of bots just like these. They can come in handy!

                        <h4>☀ Italian Corner</h4>
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        Looking for torrents in Italian? Your best bet might be <a href="https://www.icv-crew.com/forum/" target="_blank"><span class="orange">Il Corsaro Verde (ICV crew)</span></a>, which is my go-to nowadays.<br>
                        <br>
                        Those around my age or older might remember TNT Village as the n.1 source of italian torrents. 
                        It's closed down, but you can still access the magnet link for their old uploads.<br>
                        Only way to access them right now is directly via the CSV dump: 
                        <a href="https://github.com/edoardopigaiani/tntvillage-release-dump" target="_blank"><span class="orange">CSV dump</span></a>. <br>
                        It's a bit tricky - you need to open the CSV file with a software such as OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel. 
                        You will see on the first line, what do each of the string of numbers mean. 
                        You then need to find the torrent you're looking for, searching for keywords manually, and grab the "HASH" 
                        sequence (the longest sequence). You then want to feed it in a <a href="https://www.hashtomagnet.com/">hash to magnet converter</a>. 
                        You can then paste the magnet link into your torrent client. It's a lot!<br>
                        <br>
                        There's also 
                        <a href="https://www.programmiedovetrovarli.it/" target="_blank"><span class="orange">programmiedovetrovarli</span></a>, 
                        great resource for famous software (Adobe, Office, etc) with instructions in italian. 
                        Needs adblocker to be deactivated on their site, but has no popup ads, just standard banners.
