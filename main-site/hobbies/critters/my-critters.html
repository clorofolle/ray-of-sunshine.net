                    <p>
                        I've wanted to keep a pet snail for quite a while - and then the gods of fresh produce <em>(read: local greengrocers)</em> graced me with a lettuce with a free embedded snail inside! Snails are hardy creatures, and <a class="nutshell" href="#shesnail">:she</a> didn't seem too bothered from having spent a few days in the fridge - so of course I had to adopt her.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I noticed her coloration was different to what I'm used to. That's because she's no common <em>garden snail</em>, she's a <em><strong>green</strong> garden snail</em>!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The common garden snail is also called <em>Cornu aspersum</em>. This little girlie here, instead, is a <em class="purple">Cantareus apertus</em>. <a href="https://www.onezoom.org/life/@Cantareus=2879971?otthome=%40Cantareus%3D2879971#x1642,y-15,w1.5797" target="_blank">This is where she is on the big tree of life</a> - as you can see, the two are more like cousins rather than siblings, which is pretty fascinating.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They owe their genus name <em>Cantareus</em> by the fact that they are... singers! It roughly means "singer" in latin <span style="font-size: xx-small;">don't @ me if you studied latin, I will never remember my declinations</span>. This is because <span class="purple">they <a class="nutshell" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWOhZWLkd4o">:make a very unique sound when bothered!</a></span> I've been caught completely off guard by that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She's lovely: curious, inquisitive, bold, goofy. I just wish I'd researched more about her species before falling in love with her: apparently we share the common trait of being serial sleepygirls. Cantareus apertus seem to sleep for most of the year! She's now <a class="nutshell" href="#aestivation">:aestivating</a> buried deep in the soil of the tank I finally finished setting up for her. I miss her, but hope to see her back in the fall!

                        I found these two tiny creatures while hunting for woodlice in my potted plants. I thought they were babies, but a kind discord user identified them as a <em>Ferrusacia</em> species. These little things are quite common in mediterranean countries, and they stay as small as a fingernail!<br>
                        There's not much info out there about them - all I can say is that they're fast and cunning escape artists!

                        Very goofy yet carismatic crustaceans! They are a joy to watch scurry around doing their little crustacean things - and are really hard to get a good pic of, as they're either moving about, or hidden under something.

                    <p>
                        A natural variation of P. Scaber is <em>calico</em> - they will sometimes have orange/brownish and black spots all over their body. Someone then started selecting for clearer and more consistent spotting, and thus the <em>lava</em> morpho was born! which is what I have here. Pics don't render justice to how cool these little guys look!

                Most snails, unlike most animals we keep as pets, are <em>hermaphrodites</em>! They possess both male and female reproductive organs, and can even occasionally self-fecundate! So while assigning a "gender" to an animal is always a slightly silly endeavour, it's at least ten times as silly with snails. But "snail" is a feminine noun in Italian, and so I've decided that she's a girlie.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h6>:x aestivation</h6>
            <p>
                <em>Aestivation</em> is the complementary state to <em>hibernation</em>. Animals hibernate when it's way too cold out for them - and aestivate when it's way too hot, or dry.<br>
                I guarantee I'm still keeping her tank humid, and it's no hotter than 25Â°C these days - her species is just known to aestivate from May to Semptember/October, and then hang around a bit before going back to hibernation around November/December. How do they manage?? I have no idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                When they decide to enter dormancy, snails "close" the door of their shell by creating a layer - called <em>epiphragm</em>. These can be more or less solid depending on species. I'm sure you've already seen a snail hibernating before!
