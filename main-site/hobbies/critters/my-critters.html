                            Very goofy yet carismatic crustaceans! They are a joy to watch scurry around doing their little crustacean things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A natural variation of P. Scaber is <em>calico</em> - they will sometimes have orange/brownish and black spots all over their body. Someone then started selecting for clearer and more consistent spotting, and thus the <em>lava</em> morpho was born! which is what I have here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the months since I bought the small starter colony, their population exploded! They're insanely prolific and easy to care for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now that there's a lot of them they've gotten especially bold, and I see many of them out and about in any given time. They go wild when I feed them mealworms.

                        <p>
                           I'd been dreaming of keeping a garden snail for a while - and then the gods of fresh produce <em>(read: local greengrocers)</em> graced me with a lettuce with a free embedded snail inside! Snails are hardy creatures, and <a class="nutshell" href="#shesnail">:she</a> didn't seem too bothered from having spent a few days in the fridge - so of course I had to adopt her.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            I noticed her coloration was different to what I'm used to. That's because she's no common <em>garden snail</em>, she's a <em><strong>green</strong> garden snail</em>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The common garden snail is also called <em>Cornu aspersum</em>. This little girlie here, instead, is a <em class="purple">Cantareus apertus</em>. <a href="https://www.onezoom.org/life/@Cantareus=2879971?otthome=%40Cantareus%3D2879971#x1642,y-15,w1.5797" target="_blank">This is where she is on the big tree of life</a> - as you can see, the two are more like cousins rather than siblings, which is pretty fascinating.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They owe their genus name <em>Cantareus</em> by the fact that they are... singers! It roughly means "singer" in latin <span style="font-size: xx-small;">don't @ me if you studied latin, I will never remember my declinations</span>. This is because <span class="purple">they <a class="nutshell" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWOhZWLkd4o">:make a very unique sound when bothered!</a></span> I've been caught completely off guard by that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She's lovely: curious, inquisitive, bold, goofy. I just wish I'd researched more about her species before falling in love with her: apparently we share the common trait of being serial sleepygirls. Cantareus apertus seem to sleep for most of the year! She's now <a class="nutshell" href="#aestivation">:aestivating</a> buried deep in the soil of the tank I finally finished setting up for her. I miss her, but hope to see her back in the fall!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2025 Edit: Sadly, in late summer I discovered she didn't survive aestivation. It's hard to guess why: maybe she didn't have enough time to prepare her reserves for the summer, or maybe her health wasn't good in the first place. I'm leaving her section up, because she was adorable and a fun type of snail. I hope I was able to treat her right in the couple of months I adopted her for.

                            I found these two tiny creatures while hunting for woodlice in my potted plants. I thought they were babies, but a kind discord user identified them as a <em>Ferrusacia</em> species. These little things are quite common in mediterranean countries, and they stay as small as a fingernail!<br>
                            There's not much info out there about them - all I can say is that they're fast and cunning escape artists!

                            2025 update: these fellas are TINY, are diggers, and are hardly seen around. I was glad to still spot at least one in late 2024! It seemed to be doing just fine.

                However, I noticed now in january 2025 that they stopped working in details elements. So keep that in mind! This is currently custom JS to mimick regular details and summary elements while keeping Nutshell working everywhere.

            <p>
                Most snails, unlike most animals we keep as pets, are <em>hermaphrodites</em>! They possess both male and female reproductive organs, and can even occasionally self-fecundate! So while assigning a "gender" to an animal is always a slightly silly endeavour, it's at least ten times as silly with snails. But "snail" is a feminine noun in Italian, and so I've decided that she's a girlie.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h6>:x aestivation</h6>
            <p>
                <em>Aestivation</em> is the complementary state to <em>hibernation</em>. Animals hibernate when it's way too cold out for them - and aestivate when it's way too hot, or dry.<br>
                I guarantee I'm still keeping her tank humid, and it's no hotter than 25Â°C these days - her species is just known to aestivate from May to Semptember/October, and then hang around a bit before going back to hibernation around November/December. How do they manage?? I have no idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                When they decide to enter dormancy, snails "close" the door of their shell by creating a layer - called <em>epiphragm</em>. These can be more or less solid depending on species. I'm sure you've already seen a snail hibernating before!

        <!-- Alas, it looks like Nutshell doesn't work in details elements anymore as of January 2025. Because of this, summary and details elements have been replaced for the moment. This is the script to make it work: -->
        <script>
            document.querySelectorAll('.custom-summary').forEach(summary => {
                summary.addEventListener('click', () => {
                    const content = summary.nextElementSibling; // The .custom-content
                    content.style.display = content.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';
                });
            });
