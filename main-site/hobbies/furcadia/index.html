                            All you need to do is create an account on their <a href="https://cms.furcadia.com/">official website!</a> <br> then you can choose to play on:

                            ✦ <a href="https://cms.furcadia.com/download">The downloadable client</a> (the more stable option, but works on Windows only)<br>
                            ✦ <a href="https://play.furcadia.com/">The web client</a> (has a few issues and the UI doesn't look 100% as good as on the client, but will work everywhere, even on mobile! And there's nothing to install.)

                        <p>Good question!</p>
                        <p>
                            Furcadia is a MMO, where everyone is encouraged to find their own fun. You can <span class="purple">socialize and make friends</span>, find a group to <span class="purple">roleplay</span> with, or <span class="purple">explore</span> the dozens of intricate maps created by talented users. Some of them are interactive and offer minigames (think roblox, but 2D and without the gross profiting off of kids!), others serve as a pretty background for roleplay scenes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Online spaces like Furcadia thrive when its community, even if small, is active and passionate and enjoys what the platform has to offer. Furcadia will probably never be as active as it was 10 years ago, when it counted 4000 active daily users. With its dated UI and 2d graphics it doesn't catch the eye of many.<br>
                            But it can still be a great place where likeminded people can meet, have fun, and be endlessly creative - <span class="purple">not in spite but thanks to its limitations!</span> 2d pixel art means that <span class="purple">even you can create assets for it, customize your UI to your liking</span>, etc etc.<br>
                            Not to mention the ability to <span class="purple">create entire maps</span> and populate it with <span class="purple">custom avatars</span>! It has a custom language you can use to <span class="purple">code events</span> - if ten year old me was able to code some simple events in their map, so could you!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have a liking for the indie web, and don't mind trading off immediacy for more customization, self expression, and in-depth interaction, a game like Furcadia might interest you!

                            So you downloaded furcadia, logged on, but are completely lost. How the hell do you navigate this thing?<br>
                            Let's start with the <span class="purple">basics</span>. Maps in this game are called <span class="purple">Dreams</span>! And when you boot your game, well, <em>you start dreaming</em>. The dream you'll spawn in at first is a dream called <em class="purple">Challenges</em>. It's meant to be beginner friendly and teach you the ropes, but to be honest it doesn't do the best job of it, so feeling lost is more than understandable.   
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="/images/hobbies/furcadia/challenges 1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the game.">
                            <figcaption>
                                This is what you'll see when you boot into the game!
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            The glowing, purple thing on the right is a <span class="purple">Dream Portal</span>! And, you guessed it, it allows you to travel to another dream. The one you see right there is a <span class="purple">Welcome Tutorial</span>, so bump into it to get the basics of the game!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can <span class="purple">move with arrow keys, mouse</span> (hover on the area near your character and you'll see arrows pointing in the direction you'll be going), or the little arrows with numbers on the bottom left part of the UI. <span class="purple" style="text-decoration: underline;">You can only move diagonally in Furcadia!</span> It takes a bit to get used to, but becomes second nature eventually.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You might also see some <span class="purple">other players</span> hanging around at South-East (see the character circled in red, right below your character?). <em>If they're online</em> they'll probably greet you - <span class="purple">they're here to help out and welcome newcomers!</span> So feel free to say hi and ask for help, or a tour of the game. If they're there, it means they were waiting for you, and would be thrilled to show you around!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If they don't say anything, chances are, they're distracted or <span class="purple">AFK</span> (Away From Keyboard - not physically at the computer). If that's the case, I will teach you how to grab their attention in the next section!
                        </p>

                    <div class="margins">
                        <p>
                            Furcadia's population is for the most part from the USA, so activity levels may vary during the day.<br>
                            To see <span class="purple">how many people there are on a given map with you</span>, just <span class="purple"><em style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline;">press F4</em></span>. You can click on their names to "see" them, which allows you to see their description and portrait!<br>
                            Be sure to <span class="purple">hover on links</span> in their description, sometimes people hide stuff in there! ;D<br>
                            If any of them have the words <span class="purple"><em>whisper friendly</em>, <em>WF</em>, or even just <em>friendly</em></span>, you're encouraged to talk to them. If they're at their computer, they'll probably be happy to chat!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, how does <em class="purple" style="font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline;">Whispering</em> work?<br>
                            They're the <span class="purple">private messages</span> of the Furcadia world. If you're roleplaying, it could mean you privately whispered something to someone near you. But most of the time, people just use it to chat while in different dreams, or different parts of the same dream.

                        <p>
                            There are two ways to whisper to someone. The easiest is to <span class="purple">right click their name, and choose Whisper from the options.</span><br>
                            This will open up a separate chat box and you can type you message there!<br>
                            Alternatively, you can type <code><em>/username yourmessagehere</em></code> in the regular game chat, and press enter. (For example, <code><em>/Felce you stink</em></code>). This will automatically open the new window, in which you will have sent your message already. Don't forget the slash before the username!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But maybe, there aren't many players at all in your current dream. Let's find more!

                            It's up to you to explore and find a dream you like, and a community to populate it. Still, another way to find out where most people are is this <a href="https://dreamnova.net/">really neat site called DreamNova</a>. Basically, a bot will "dreamhop" (jump from dream to dream) and count how many players there are in any given dream, so you know roughly what dreams are the most populated. Links to dreams included inside. Give it a go!
