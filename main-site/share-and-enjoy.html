                    I know the issue of stealing other people's code is a debated topic in the community - 
                    especially on Neocities, where a lot of less savvy people

                        You probably already noticed how in the footer at the end of each page there's this 
                        little button: 
                        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="max-width: 88px;" src="../images/buttons/by-nc-sa.png"></a><br>
                        This here specifies the "license" this website and its contents are released under.<br>
                        In short, it specifies what you can or cannot legally do with the stuff I made myself.<br>
                        <br>
                        This one is pretty straightforward!<br>
                        <span class="purple" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You can copy, modify, and share anything of my creation  
                        that I host on this website!</strong> Be it html, art, words.</span><br>
                        <br>
                        The caveat is: you can use it for <strong>noncommercial purposes only</strong> (you cannot make money out of it), 
                        you should <strong>credit me</strong> (a link back somewhere on your site/on the art is all I need! No need to credit me if you just grab some html or take inspiration), and 
                        if you modify my stuff, you must <strong>re-share what you create under the same license</strong>!<br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="purple">So basically: go nuts, don't make money out of it, keep it free for other people.</span><br>
                        Also, if you create something from anything I made, I would be <em>delighted</em> to see it! No obligation though.<br>
                        <br>
                        Another thing I politerly ask for, is to <span class="purple">please don't use my characters as your own.</span><br> 
                        Putting my art of them on your site would be a honour and you're free to have them hanging around!<br>
                        Just please, don't go around using them as your avatars or sonas. Thank you!<br>

                        The image I use as a border for my main divs is a 1000x1000px image.<br>
                        It's larger than it has any rights to be, and I resize it via CSS.<br>
                        <img style="max-width: 200px;" src="../navborder250.png">
                        <br>
                        This is the CSS I use, that works for me personally:
                        <div style="text-align: left;">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
.greenbox {
    border: 5px solid transparent;
    border-image-source: url(navborder250.png);
    border-image-slice: 250;
    border-image-width: 10;
    border-image-outset: 4 3 2 3;
    border-image-repeat: round;
    background-color: rgb(203, 234, 157);
}                             
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        
                        ❧ The <strong>'border'</strong> attributes creates an actual, solid border to place our image on top of 
                        - but since it's transparent, you won't even see it! It occupies actual volume, and for my 
                        purposes I kept it quite thin (5px).<br>
                        <br>
                        ❧<strong>'border-image-source'</strong> fetches the actual image to use on the border!<br>
                        <br>
                        ❧ <strong>'border-image-slice'</strong> decides at which point the image needs to be "sliced" 
                        into separate sections, for the corners and the sides. In my case, I opted to divide 
                        my 1000px square image in such a way to have borders be half the lenght of the "inner" border.
                        <br>
                        <img style="max-width: 150px;" src="../images/misc/border-exp.PNG"><br>
                        So, I divided my 1000px side by 4: 250px.<br>
                        My CSS will try to slice my side one time for each 250px. The first and last chunks will be used 
                        for the corners and will not repeat; the chunks that are in the middle will be the actual border.
                        In the image above, I have tried to mark the slices that were relevant for me to work with.<br>
                        <br>
                        ❧<strong>border-image-width</strong> controls the actual width of your image. I kept it very small at 
                        10, as I like the look. But you can have it be much bigger:

                    <strong>Javascript disclaimer:</strong> the little JS I have so far was written by a language model. 
                    I'm still starting to study JS but was eager to get a few things to be functional here. 
                    So, none of the Javascript was written by me - but I do not think it infringes on anyone's rights, either. <a href="thoughts.html#AI">Here's my full thoughts on the matter.</a><br>
                    Putting this out there in case you have ethical qualms about using this code!<br>
                    <a href="txt-pages/load.js.txt" target="_blank">☀ load.js</a>: 
                    code that allows for the header, sidebars, and footer to be loaded dynamically on 
                    each page (so I don't have to change each of them manually on each page when I want 
                    to update something on them!)<br>
                    To use this, you just need to set a &lt;div&gt; to have a certain ID, and tell the JS what 
                    html page corresponds to that ID. In my case, 'header.html' corresponds to id="header". 
                    When I put a "<code>&lt;div id="header"&gt;</code>" in my page's body, it will automatically 
                    load the contents of "header.html" there.<br>
                    <br>
                    <a href="txt-pages/language.js.txt" target="_blank">☀ language.js</a>: 
                    the JS code that handles the little language switching button in the top right.<br>
                    It's absurdly simple: the text for both the italian and english is already in the html. 
                    However, they're in separate divs with different classes (.eng and .ita). The language that 
                    is not displayed by default, however, also has another class: '.hidden'.<br>
                    The CSS for that class has a 'display:none' attribute, which makes it invisible.<br>
                    Now - the little button on my header is like this:
                    <pre><code>&lt;button onclick="toggleLanguage()"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
                    Which means - when it's pressed, it triggers the "toggleLanguage" function. 
                    All that function does, then, is take the '.hidden' class and switch it around: if previously 
                    object with the '.ita' class also had an '.hidden' class, now it's the '.eng' objects that 
                    are hidden! So it looks like text is getting replaced - in truth, I am just showing you two 
                    entirely different divs.<br>

                    <a href="txt-pages/music.js.txt" target="_blank">☀ music.js</a>: 
                    this code handles the playlists (like the one in the about-me page). It only uses native HTML & CSS 
                    elements, but creates a functional playlist that can play songs in order. There are annotations inside 
                    for the explanations the LLM gave me on how the different parts of the code works. But it's really 
                    tricky for me! I hope to be able to learn how to create stuff like this myself sooner or later.
